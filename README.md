# Introduction_to_Keras

This repository is an introduction to the Keras deep learning framework for Python users who do not have experience building neural networks.

### There are two notebook files

##### Overview_of_Neural_Networks.ipynb 
This notebook is a text-only document that reviews the basics of neural networks, the features of Keras relevant to building simple models, and a set of links and resources to learn more.  There is also an HTML version of the content.

##### Introduction_to_Keras.ipynb
This notebook contains a simple and straightforward example of training a neural network model to recognize hand-written digits (MNIST dataset).

### Other resources in this repository

##### Introduction_to_Keras.mp4
This video is a recording of a talk from the February 2018 meeting of the ChiPy, the premier Python users group in Chicago.  In this presentation, I introduce the Keras library, walk through the Introduction_to_Keras notebook, and answer some questions from the audience.

##### Introduction_to_Keras.pptx
Slides for the ChiPy talk.
